# Project--Hadoop-2

<table>

 **In this project we use Apache Spark and coded it using python to find the Top 10 LowestRatingMovie from u.data dataset**.<br></br>
 
  **This dataset contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
  **(UserId):** The user id of person who rated the movie<br></br>
  **(Movie-Id):** The movie id of movie which users rated<br></br>
  **(Ratings):** The ratings which the user gave to the given movie<br></br>
  **(Timestamp):** The time at which the user rated the given movie<br></br>
  
  
Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
It is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size.<br></br>
Apache Spark is a data processing framework that can quickly perform processing tasks on very large data sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other distributed computing tools. These two qualities are key to the worlds of big data and machine learning, which require the marshalling of massive computing power to crunch through large data stores. Spark also takes some of the programming burdens of these tasks off the shoulders of developers with an easy-to-use API that abstracts away much of the grunt work of distributed computing and big data processing.<br></br>
From its humble beginnings in the AMPLab at U.C. Berkeley in 2009, Apache Spark has become one of the key big data distributed processing frameworks in the world. Spark can be deployed in a variety of ways, provides native bindings for the Java, Scala, Python, and R programming languages, and supports SQL, streaming data, machine learning, and graph processing. You‚Äôll find it used by banks, telecommunications companies, games companies, governments, and all of the major tech giants such as Apple, IBM, Meta, and Microsoft.<br></br>
