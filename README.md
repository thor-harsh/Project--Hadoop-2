# Project--Hadoop-2

<table>

 **In this project we use Apache Spark and coded it using python to find the Top 10 LowestRatingMovie from u.data dataset**.<br></br>
 
  **This dataset contains 4 columns:** <br></br>
  **(UserId):** The user id of person who rated the movie<br></br>
  **(Movie-Id):** The movie id of movie which users rated<br></br>
  **(Ratings):** The ratings which the user gave to the given movie<br></br>
  **(Timestamp):** The time at which the user rated the given movie<br></br>
  
  
Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
It is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size.

 **Important-Note: Go through the dataset before going to the code.**
